* TODO In rtags bind (kbd "C-M-.") to go to symbol in other window, as is done with elpy/python
* TODO Clear python output before each time python buffer is run elpy-shell-send-region-or-buffer (C-c C-c) appends output to the end of the inferior python buffer. I'd like it to erase prior output before sending new output.
* TODO Bring python buffer to front at each run

Each time a python buffer is run with elpy-shell-send-region-or-buffer, the inferior python
buffer should appear in the other window, instead of sending the output to the minibuffer if the
inferior python buffer is not at the front.

* TODO Create macro for certain consistent bindings

Some bindings are reimplemented in more than one major mode to call different backend functions but
perform the same conceptual function. These should be replaced with a single definition at the
beginning of the init file so that it can be changed once. For instance, jump-to-definition is
implemented with "M-." currently. If I decide to change that in the future, I'd like to change it
once and have the change propagate to all jump-to-def keybindings (the same keybinding should
perform the same function in all modes).

* TODO Enable plotting in python buffer output

Currently, running C-c C-c in a python buffer does not allow plotting. ein supports this
functionality by default. Therefore, it may be best to change the default python shell to an ein
console. Is this `ein:console-connect'?

* TODO Get mediawiki working
* TODO Prevent "$" from acting as a pair in any mode except tex modes.
* TODO Use eww by default and command to open in another browser if necessary

The other browser would probably be firefox at the moment, but at some point the internal xwidget
browser. Also bind eww and open other browser to keybindings.

* TODO Setup eudc/ldap to complete/store email addresses etc.

This configuration will go in ~/.emacs.d/.gnus.el. See the [[info:eudc#Top][eudc info manual]] and the [[info:eudc#LDAP%20Configuration][LDAP
configuration section]] within it. Also check the [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/OpenLDAP][ArchWiki OpenLDAP page]] for information about
openldap, including how to install and configure it. It's also worth checking git revisions to see
the old gnus configuration for further ideas.

* TODO Better completions in Eshell.

I can maybe use [[https://github.com/szermatt/emacs-bash-completion][Bash completions]] or even [[https://gitlab.com/ambrevar/emacs-fish-completion][Fish completions]] but I'm worried this might generate
misleading scenarios where eshell doesn't actually behave like Bash.

* TODO Org init file

Look at [[https://github.com/dakra/dmacs/blob/master/init.org][this setup]] for an example of an org init file. Additionally, this provides a lot of
solid-looking setup configurations. Look through these for inspiration.

* TODO Consider changing helm mini-buffer appearance

Now that I'm using Eshell instead of term, it probably makes sense to have the helm-minibuffer only
appear as a small part of the current buffer.

* TODO Change fill-column to 70 for all text modes (prog modes should probably stay at 100)
* TODO Prevent fill-column word wrapping when building a table in org-mode.
* TODO Create org shortcut for filing issues

This should be a global minor mode with an associated key sequence. It should prompt you to specify
which of a collection of projects has an issue, and then file an issue in the appropriate section of
that project.

* TODO Reuse buffers for dired-mode

This is allegedly answered [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/1041/20317][here]], but it isn't working for me.
* TODO Bind org-store-link to a kbd (maybe C-c l?)
* TODO Use lexical binding in init file
* TODO Async shell mode should default to normal mode, not insert mode
* TODO Bind kbd (maybe C-r) in eshell mode to helm-eshell-history
